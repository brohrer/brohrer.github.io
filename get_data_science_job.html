        <h4>5. Decline the offer</h4>
          
        <h4>6. Go to step one</h4>

        <p>
          &nbsp
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually you’ll reach a point, where you can’t quite bring yourself to follow through on step five. The position isn’t exactly what you were looking for but it feels so right, you can’t let it go. Then you’re done.
        </p>
        <h4>Heads up</h4>
         <p>
           Every time a company doesn't make you an offer, it will hurt. Even though you were going to turn them down, it will still feel like a punch to the stomach. You'll question whether you are smart enough or young enough or experienced enough or prepared enough. This is normal. It sucks. Embrace the disappointment. Vent to your boyfriend or call your brother or go dancing or have a tall glass of Scotch. Whatever your process, work through it, all the while repeating in your mind "I am enough." Because you are. Then loop back to step one and give it another go.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method is guaranteed to work. It is a while loop, and the termination criterion is success. Or in the words of John Lennon, “Everything will be okay in the end. If it is not okay, then it is not the end.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy hunting!
