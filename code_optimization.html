          I don't need to tell you why it's nice to have your code run fast.
          Here are some tricks I've found helpful, starting with the
          most bang for the buck.
        </p>
        <h4>1. Profile</h4>
        <p>
          You can't know how to make your code faster until you know how
          it is slow. Profiling tools let you see how much time your
          code is spending on which lines and operations.
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html">
            cProfile</a> is a classic and you can't go wrong with it,
          but my personal favorite right now is
          <a href="https://github.com/benfred/py-spy">py-spy</a>.
          It doesn't require you to modify
          your code at all and doesn't slow it down.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Elimination</h4>
        <p>
          The fastest code is the code that never runs. After working on
          code for a while it's amazing how much cruft accumulates.
          Deleting it is the best optimization trick.
          And the best part is you don't incur any technical debt &mdash;
          there's no new code to hide bugs and no new libraries to depend on.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Avoidance</h4>
        <p>
          Some code only needs to be run some of the time. The addition of
          if-else checks can help you avoid costly computations that aren't
          strictly necessary.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Cacheing</h4>
        <p>
          Your code may be computing the same thing several times.
          Store it and re-use it, rather than re-computing it.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Pre-processing</h4>
        <p>
          This is similar to cacheing, but uses the disk. If you have to
          transform the data in a table every time you load it,
          you might be able to save a lot of time by making a
          separate table with the pre-transformed data. Then each time
          you use it, it's all ready to go.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Vectorization</h4>
        <p>
          If you're working with many numbers in Python, put them in arrays and
          use <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>.
          Avoid for loops whenever possible. You will be amazed how fast
          it goes.
        </p>

        <h4>7. Algorithms and Data Types</h4>
        <p>
          This is the level where the computer science courses pay off.
          (Or where you might want to look into reading some CS literature.)
          Choosing the right algorithm for what you are trying to do can
          sometimes reduce a
          longer-than-the-age-of-the-universe calculatation down to
          five minutes. This will be entirely case-specific and will
          require you to know roughly how many bits are doing what at each
          point in your program. It's a fun direction to head in,
          and sometimes you can get caught up in it so completely that you
          forget about the problem you were originally trying to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Closely related is choosing the right data type. Again,
          it will depend on exactly what you are doing, but having the right
          data type can totally change the game. While working on
          <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/many-to-many-dijkstra">
            a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm</a>, a switch from a
          list to a heap sped up the algorithm by five orders of magnitude
          (100,000X). It can pay to understand what's going on under the
          hood.
        </p>

        <h4>8. Acceleration</h4>
        <p>
          After you've removed all the unnecessary code, vectorized,
          tweaked your algorithms, and made sure
          that nothing heavy runs more often than it needs to, and you
          still feel the need to speed up your code, you can
          move up to next level. When you're working in Python, you can
          get big speedups by compiling your code into C.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite
          tool for doing this is
          <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a>,
          which is shockingly easy to use. The biggest cost is that
          it can introduce some debugging challenges, but
          nothing that can't be navigated with persistence.
          I've seen it speed up code more than 50 times.
          If you have nested for loops with branching logic, Numba is
          your new best friend.
        </p>

        <h4>9. Parallelization</h4>
        <p>
          If you <em>still</em> need to speed up your code, you are now
          in the realm of brute force. The first brute force trick is
          to split up your code and run it on lots of processors at the same
          time. It isn't any more efficient, but now you have an army
          instead of a lone soldier.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several tools for doing this. On a local machine,
          I prefer
          <a href="
            https://e2eml.school/multiprocessing.html
          ">
            the multiprocessing package</a>. I've also had excellent
          experiences with
          <a href="https://github.com/joblib/joblib">joblib</a>.
          There are of course many others, and that doesn't even touch
          cloud tools that scale to add as many processors as you want. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Take note, parallelization can open up a lot of doors for demons
          to enter. Communication and coordination become tricker,
          and debugging can become an absolute nightmare. It can be a
          tremendous boost to your compute power, but it will not be painless.
        </p>

        <h4>10. Graphical Processing Units</h4>
        <p>
          When you need blink-and-it's-gone speed, you skip software
          altogether and hard wire your computation directly into silicon.
          Forty years ago, the ancestors of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">
            Graphical Processing Unit</a> (GPU) were specialized video cards
          created to render video at higher frame rates. Through the years
          they have evolved to do more sophisticated graphics computations,
          like 3D rotation and shading. Underlying all this is exceptionally
          fast matrix compuation and a ridiculously large number of processors.
          This just so happens to match the needs of some
          artificial neural networks. If you can coerce your code to run
          on a GPU (or take advantage of a library that has already solved
          that problem) it can speed up your code by hundreds of times.
        </p>
        <p>
          This path has two dangers, one obvious and one less so. The obvious
          danger is that it can be hard work to get your code to run on
          entirely different hardware. The rules have changed.
          Your intuitions can be wrong.
          Debugging GPUs is a specialized discipline of its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second is that you are placing a bet that the computations you
          need to do are what the GPU can do. There are lots of things that
          GPUs can't do, or at least can't do better than a CPU. Be very
          honest with yourself about whether you need what they have to offer.
          You might be missing out on mind-blowing algorithmic innovations
          just because the GPU API doesn't have a command for that.
          It's great to strap a jet engine to your bicycle, but you need
          to be really sure that your bicycle is point pointed in the
          right direction before you ignite it.
        </p>

        <h3>Beware the Rabbit Hole</h3>
        <p>
          Like Alice chasing the White Rabbit, it's tempting to set our sights
          on code speed at the expense of everything else &mdash; complexity,
          brittleness, dependencies, memory. Worse, it's all to easy to
          chase small performance wins in parts of our code that are already
          fast, rather than focusing on the slowest ones. Keep your sights
          set on the big goal: ease of use. Buying a 5% speedup
          with a doubled memory footprint may not be worth it.
        </p>

            We should forget about small efficiencies,
            say about 97 percent of the time: premature optimization is
            the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our
            opportunities in that critical 3 percent.
