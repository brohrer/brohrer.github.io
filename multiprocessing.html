          If you spend a lot of time waiting around for your code to run,
          and you've tried all the easier things, you can sometimes get
          a big speedup by parallelizing it &mdash; breaking it into
          chunks and running each chunk separately. Laptops typically
          typically have at least two cores, and many have four.
          Desktop boxes can have as many as 32. But Python is single-threaded.
          By default it will only run on one core at a time.
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html">
            The <code>multiprocessing</code> package</a> helps us to use as
          many cores as we want.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a minimal example that you can copy and paste to get
          started with.
        </p>
<pre><code>from multiprocessing import Pool
import os
import numpy as np

def f(n):
    return np.var(np.random.sample((n, n)))

result_objs = []
n = 1000
with Pool(processes=os.cpu_count() - 1) as pool:
    for _ in range(n):
        result = pool.apply_async(f, (n,))
        result_objs.append(result)
    
    results = [result.get() for result in result_objs]
    print(len(results), np.mean(results), np.var(results))
</code></pre>
        (<a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1924217">
          Here's the snippet on GitLab.</a>)
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>f(n)</code> a function with a burdensome calculation.   
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool">
                <code>Pool</code></a> is a collection of worker processes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              When initializing a <code>Pool</code>,
              the <code>processes</code> keyword argument
              chooses how many workers to create. It doesn't make sense
              to create more workers than you have processors.
              <code>os.cpu_count()</code> tells you exactly how many that is.
              If you leave one
              processor free you can still run Firefox and listen to Spotify
              while your code runs.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>Pool.apply_async()</code> assigns a job to your worker
              pool, but doesn't wait around for the result. Instead it returns
              a placeholder. We can use the placeholder to get the actual
              result by calling <code>result_placeholder.get()</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>Pool.apply_async()</code> takes a function as a first
              argument and a tuple of arguments for that function
              as a second argument. Because we want each worker to
              run <code>f(n)</code>, we pass <code>apply_async(f, (n,))</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you were to immediately call <code>get()</code> on the
              result placeholder from <code>apply_async()</code>,
              it would hold up the for loop while it waited for the result.
              In parallelization terminology, it blocks all the other
              workers from getting new jobs. In this case, you would still
              have several workers, but they would each take turns doing one
              job while the others stood around and waited. Better to
              collect all the result placeholders and gather up the
              results when the works have done their jobs.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The <code>multiprocessing</code> package is incredibly powerful.
          This is only the tiniest part of its capabilities. But hopefully
          it's a part that you'll find particularly useful.
