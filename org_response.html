          First some caveats:
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>
              These are my own opinions and may have no relation to the position of my employer.
            </li>
            <li>
              I’m not an expert in this area. These are opinions only.
            </li>
            <li>
              These are not in direct reference to my own experiences with
              specific employers, past or present. Rather, they are an
              aggregation of thoughts based on accumulated experience over a
              lifetime of associations with organizations of all sorts, and the
              second-hand accounts of others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most importantly <strong>I haven't experienced what you've
              experienced</strong>. Take anything here that's useful and
              discard the rest.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I struggled with when to release this post. It's natural to look at whatever happened in the news yesterday and assume it was a trigger. But this has been brewing for decades.
        </p>

        <h3>Help! A leader in my organization did something I hate.</h3>
        <h3>What do I do?</h3>

        <p>
          Poor behavior by an organization’s leaders isn’t an uncommon
          scenario, nor is it a new one. Most of us will find ourselves in the
          situation at some point. What do we do when our academic
          institution/company/nonprofit does something unethical, illegal, or
          in really poor taste? How do we trade off the
          benefits of membership with the taint of association? This is an
          intensely personal question, and there’s no way I can answer it for
          you, but I can offer some starting points for considering your
          response. 
        </p>

        <h3>It hurts</h3>

        <p>
          When this happens, the initial experience is one of pain. You may
          feel one or more of these:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Betrayal of trust</strong>. This type of behavior is not what you signed on for. Maybe you just wanted satisfying employment or to make the world a little better place. And maybe leaders have said lofty things about values and vision. Then this happened. It’s a bait-and-switch and you feel betrayed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Personal injury</strong>. Leaders' actions may hurt you directly. Sexual harassment and discrimination are all-to-common ways for this to happen, but it can also come in the form of verbal abuse, recognition withheld, or failing to provide a physically safe work environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Guilt</strong>. You may feel bad about yourself for being part of something that fails to live up to its promises. You might even feel personally accountable for leaders’ actions. This can manifest as a persistent gnawing feeling in your stomach that makes it hard to get out of bed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Shame</strong>. It’s really natural to feel worried about what other people think&mdash;that they judge you as a sellout or a lemming or a pawn, weak or greedy or foolish. They may even say it in a tweet or to your face over holiday dinners. That stings.
        </p>

        <p>
          While you are feeling these, keep your eyes open for 
          <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting"">
            <strong>gaslighting</strong></a>, where someone
          tries to convince you that the problem is you.
          Either you
          misunderstood, or you are too sensitive, or there were some
          extenuating circumstances, or everyone knows that's just how Steve
          is. Gaslighting is manipulative, and it plays on our need
          to calibrate our social interpretations with others. Stick to your
          guns. If something feels wrong or off to you, no one can gainsay
          that. If you start second-guessing your reaction, find a couple
          of people that you trust deeply and reality check your experiences
          with them. Your experiences are yours, and no one can tell you they
          aren't valid.
        </p>

        <h3>Consider your options</h3>

        <p>
          So it hurts. What can you do about it? You have a few options, and they each come with their own upside and downside.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Gadfly</strong>. Criticize the bad behavior to other members
          of the organization. Make it clear that you disapprove.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Downside</em>: Leaders may not even be aware of your
            displeasure, much less feel pressure to change. This is a good
            coping mechanism, but may not resolve the issue. If leaders do
            become
            aware of your criticisms, they may move to smooth things over or
            they may try to keep you quiet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Upside</em>: You are doing something. You don’t have to suffer
            in silence. Also, you get a chance to commiserate with other
            members of your organization and support anyone who might be
            feeling isolated. And there is always a small chance that the
            offending leader will hear and see the error of their ways.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Conscience</strong>. Call out leaders’ poor decisions but emphasize opportunities for improvement. Make a call to be better. Provide specific suggestions for corrective actions.
        </p>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <em>Downside</em>: Change is hard and so the default human position
            is to avoid it whenever possible. If leaders are not deliberately
            looking to improve, they will probably do the minimum, which is to
            say a few of the right words without making any substantive
            changes. They also might dismiss the criticism or simply do
            nothing, compounding the original sin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Upside</em>: This is a very constructive approach. It is an
            expression of trust in your leaders.
            Compared to the criticism of the Gadly, it can be easier to hear
            and respond to a Conscience while saving face.
            It gives well meaning and
            responsive leaders a chance to improve and heal the organization.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Dissenter</strong>.
          While maintaining
          affiliation with the organization, condemn the objectionable
          behavior in a public forum, like Twitter or the New York Times.
          A Dissenter is like a Gadfly, except that they
          air their grievances publicly.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Downside</em>: Unfortunately, most organizations don't take
            well to this. If you are vocal enough, you will likely be
            marginalized within the organization or even kicked out. This can
            cost a lot, both personally and professionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Upside</em>: This makes a strong statement to all your social
            and professional circles that you condemn the behavior. It puts distance between you
            and your organization and provides an escape from
            guilt and shame. When conditions are right, this can produce a
            great deal of pressure on the organization to change.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Saboteur</strong>. Stay part of the organization but deliberately
          damage it. Common approaches include obstructing operations or leaking confidential
          information.
        </p>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <em>Downside</em>: It is possible that whatever harm you do will
            touch people in the organization that were not responsible for the
            offenses. You'll need to consider your path carefully if you want
            to avoid collateral damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            There's also a risk that leaders will seek retribution.
            Depending on the circumstances, your reputation may be attacked,
            you may be sued, you may be ostracized. Very large organizations
            have a great deal of power. In extreme cases you can literally
            spend the rest of your life suffering the consequences. I don't say
            this to dissuade you, but to encourage you to think through your
            options carefully.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Upside</em>: You can do real damage this way. If you have lost faith in an organization's leaders completely and have been personally harmed, this method offers a bit of justice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Ghost</strong>. Cut affiliation with the organization.
          Find another job, another community. Move on.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Downside</em>: The original infraction goes completely
            unaddressed. There is no resolution, and no guarantee that the same
            thing won't happen again. You also lose whatever it was that drew
            you to the organization to start with - a salary, a community, a
            common cause.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Upside</em>: The immediate cause of your pain may be removed. 
            You get the chance to extricate yourself and start over. This is
            can be helpful when you have little hope of redress or improving the
            organization. You can always cut your losses and move on.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Apostate</strong>. Leave the organization and actively attack
          it from the outside.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Downside</em>: Like the Ghost, you give up whatever benefits of membership you
            had. And like the Saboteur, you may end up harming those still in
            the organization that bear no responsibility for leaders'
            actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Upside</em>: You are more free to operate, since you don't need
            to worry about complying with the organizations norms (or at least
            appearing to). Your criticism can flow freely. You are not
            untouchable, especially to very powerful organizations, but it
            raises the bar for them to retaliate. They can't hold threat of
            expulsion over you. Publicly dismissing you and
            legal recourse are more common responses. 
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Do nothing</strong>. 
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Downside</em>: Nothing changes. Whatever bad thing happened
            might well happen again. And again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Upside</em>: Sometimes it's not worth the fight. If you are
            close to retirement or vesting it can be easiest just to ride it
            out. There are lots of instances where
            the personal connections or financial benefits of membership
            outweigh whatever embarassment a leader has caused.
            Sometimes, you can't afford to just walk away.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes there just aren't any other viable options. The
            uncertainty of leaving a familiar organization can bring terror and
            paralysis. The thought of leaving friends and colleagues behind
            without support in
            a toxic environment can be profoundly distasteful.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you stay in the organization, you keep whatever goodness is there. You get to continue
            supporting your colleagues and community and drawing support from
            them. There may still be great opportunities for doing good,
            strengthening a community, or financially supporting your loved ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Do Nothing strategy can also be accompanied by a mild strain
            of the Saboteur in which you withold your best efforts. After all,
            it's hard to be committed and engaged to an organization when you
            feel disappointed or ashamed of its leaders.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Whatever your situation you have some options.
          Choosing what to do might be agonizing.
          How is it likely to play out? What’s the benefit to me and those I care about? the cost? 

Be true to yourself. You might feel strongly that you need to do something without being able to say exactly why. That’s a strong signal. If you don’t follow through with that, you are likely to regret it for a long time. eaders will resort to
        </p>

        <h3>The leaders of <em>someone else’s</em> organization did something very
          wrong.</h3>
        <h3>What do I do?</h3>

        <p>
          This is also a way-too-common situation. Again, the decision of whether and how to respond is yours alone, but I can offer a few points to consider.
        </p>

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Organizations are made of individual people</strong>. A company is made up of the
            individuals. A board is made up of individuals. A committee is made
            up of individuals. Individual leaders made very poor decisions.
            The majority of the people in that organization are not responsible
            for those decisions, and may not support them.
          </li>

          <li>
            On a related note, <strong>be gentle when judging members of the
            organization that stay</strong> or fail to condemn it. There's no way to
            know for sure what their constraints or motivations are. They may
            be doing the best they can manage at the moment.
          </li>

          <li>
            Don't put much weight on what a leader says when called out.
            Instead, watch what they do. A sincere
            and specific apology is a great start (and rare enough), but when
            accompanied by repeated offenses it doesn't count for much.
            <strong>Actions
            speak louder than words</strong>. I weight the importance actions-to-words about 20-to-1.
          </li>

          <li>
            Pointing at another organization’s failings don’t make up for those
            in your own. <strong>Make sure you're not just distracting
            yourself</strong> from
            problems closer to home or trying to redirect shame away from
            yourself.
          </li>

          <li>
            Labeling organizations as "evil" tends not to be useful. Regardless
            of their stated purpose, nearly every organization has some instances of bad
            behavior. Social irresponsibility, ethical sketchiness, or personal
            disrepect can be found almost anywhere if you look closely enough.
            Sadly, it seems to be a constant in any reasonably-sized group of
            humans. By
            some yardsticks, every organization is evil, and the word loses meaning. It's
            more useful to look at the specifics of the situation. How much
            harm was done? How powerless were the recipients? Was the incident
            isolated or part of a long-running pattern? Was it quickly remedied
            or minimized and covered up? <strong>Keeping your analysis
            concrete</strong> will help you more clearly navigate the trade-offs as you
            consider your response.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider your goals. An online rant feels good but quickly fades,
            like a rock thrown into a pond.
            <strong>Reporting specific events and advocating
            specific corrections</strong> carries far more weight and is
            longer-lived.
          </li>

        </ul>

          I hope some of the ideas here are helpful to you. If you have additions
          to suggest or a story to tell, don't hesitate to send me an email
          (brohrer@gmail.com) or post it on Twitter (@_brohrer_).

        <p>
          Know that the frustration, anger, and/or sadness that you feel is
          legitimate and that you have some options. I wish you well as you
          find your path.
