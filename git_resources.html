        <h3>Get Started with Git</h3>
        <p>
          You can get by most of your life without Git, until suddenly you
          have to write code with three other people, or worse, have to
          one day start maintaining Amy's computer vision codebase after she leaves the company
          to become a CTO. Then you have half a day to
          become an expert in this quirky little version control tool.
          Not to worry. These teachers have you covered.

          I asked my friends and colleagues on

            Twitter</a> if the knew of any Git tutorials they would recommend.
          I was overwhelmed by the response. There are a lot to choose from.
          However, a few rose to the top as being both very popular
          and exceptionally well suited for someone just starting out.
          But for every resource listed here, there are five others in the
          threads, most of them very good.

          This is an excellent all around introduction to Git at the command line.
          It stays practical, with brief forays into the underlying mechanisms
          where necessary. The video format provides extra momentum.

          Of you prefer a book format, Pro Git is an excellent way to go.
          Hosted on the Git website, it enjoys the blessing of an
          an official resource. It is comprehensive and well put together.

        <p>
          If you happen to be an R user, you will never find a better
          resource than this. Practical, cheeky, brilliantly organized,
          it is a tour de force of instructional writing. Note that 
          this guide covers both Git and GitHub, two distinct, but tightly
          interrelated tools.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Even if you're
          not an R user, I highly recommend a look through the accompanying
          manifesto:
          <a href="

            Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?

          If you want to focus on using GitHub for collaborative
          projects, or if the command line gives you the heebie-jeebies,
          this is a wonderful set of videos, mini articles, and
          hands-on exercises.
