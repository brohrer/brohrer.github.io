          <a href="https://github.com/brohrer/becca/releases/tag/0.8.1">Becca 8</a>
          is out and it has some big improvements. 
        </p>
        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>
          Becca 8 is performing well on its ten test worlds. Each one presents a different type 
          of reinforcement learning task. None of them are exceptionally challenging, 
          but for one algorithm to perform  well on all of them (as Becca does) 
          requires an exceptionally robust approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to make Becca run comfortably on laptops, most of the computation 
          is streamlined. Although it's written in python, Becca uses numba to compile 
          the hardest working parts into C. Those bits run very fast.

        <h3>Ease of use</h3>
        <p>
          Installing Becca is a one-line job on the command line.
          <pre><code>pip install becca</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Running the test worlds is easy too. In python:
          <pre><code>import becca_test.test
becca_test.test.suite()</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p> &nbsp </p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
          The good folks at
          <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI</a>
          have created a playground called Gym for Becca and agents like it.
          Learning on simulated robots of all types and complexities is a great
          opportunity to show what Becca can do. Getting Becca integrated with Gym
          is my next development goal. There are some intermediate steps, and
          I'll be working through them for the next several months.
